### Hi, I'm Arjun Vaithilingam Sudhakar ðŸ‘‹
Currently, I am in the second year of my Ph.D. studies at the Mila-Quebec AI Institute under the supervision of Professor Sarath Chandar in Montreal, Canada. I also hold a Master's degree from Mila and the University of Montreal, where I focused on machine learning. Prior to my Ph.D., I worked as a Machine Learning Engineer for three years at Wipro and as a Research Scientist Intern at Hydro Quebec, which is a government organization in Quebec, Canada.


**PhD Focus**: My research centers on the intersection of Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Large Language Models (LLM). While RL exhibits sample inefficiency, LLM boasts general-purpose knowledge but falls short in planning and sequential decision-making. My objective is to seamlessly integrate both paradigms to enhance the capabilities of general-purpose agents, equipping them with superior decision-making prowess.

**Research Interest** : Reinforcement learning, Natural language processing
