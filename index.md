### Hi, I'm Arjun Vaithilingam Sudhakar ðŸ‘‹
I am in the final year of my Research master's at Mila-Quebec AI Institute under the supervision of Professor Sarath Chandar in Montreal, Canada. I also hold a Master's degree from Mila and the University of Montreal, where I focused on language models. Before my Research Master, I worked as a Machine Learning Engineer for three years at Wipro and as a AI Research Intern at Hydro Quebec, a government organization in Quebec, Canada.


**Research Focus**: My research centers on the intersection of Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Large Language Models (LLM). While RL exhibits sample inefficiency, LLM boasts general-purpose knowledge but needs to improve in planning and sequential decision-making. My objective is to seamlessly integrate both paradigms to enhance the capabilities of general-purpose agents, equipping them with superior decision-making prowess.
