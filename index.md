### Hi, I'm Arjun Vaithilingam Sudhakar ðŸ‘‹

Currently I work as a **Senior Generative AI Scientist** at TD Bank, focusing on large language models (LLMs) for financial products. With over **six years of experience** in ML, engineering, and automation, I have extensive hands-on expertise in deploying and productizing ML models.

Also, holds **dual masterâ€™s degrees** in machine learning from Mila â€“ Quebec AI Institute, specializing in AI/ML. Before my Masters, I worked as a Machine Learning Engineer for three years at Wipro and as a AI Research Intern at Hydro Quebec, a government organization in Quebec, Canada.


**Research Focus**: My research centers on the intersection of Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Large Language Models (LLM). While RL exhibits sample inefficiency, LLM boasts general-purpose knowledge but needs to improve in planning and sequential decision-making. My objective is to seamlessly integrate both paradigms to enhance the capabilities of general-purpose agents, equipping them with superior decision-making prowess.

**Research Interest** : Reinforcement learning, Natural language processing
