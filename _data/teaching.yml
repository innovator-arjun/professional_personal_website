Proposed Idea to have Math and python tutorial for students to brush-up pre-requisites. Linear Algebra and Scikit
tutorials were created from scratch and delivered to class students. The website and YouTube lectures were kept up to date. I also kept a close track on how to improve the course next year
based on students' feedback.
