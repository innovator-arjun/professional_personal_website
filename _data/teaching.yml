    As part of the program, I had the opportunity to guide and mentor underprivileged female students in the field of Machine Learning and Deep Learning. I taught a range of supplementary materials, including mathematics, machine learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning. Additionally, I mentored a capstone project on the development of an "Emotive Application," which aimed to capture mental health information using both Machine and Deep Learning techniques over a period of four weeks.

    "I proposed the idea of providing Math and Python tutorials for students to brush up on prerequisites. I created from scratch Linear Algebra and Scikit tutorials and delivered them to the class students. In addition to teaching and grading, I also kept the website and YouTube lectures up to date. I continuously monitored student feedback to continuously improve the course by introducing auto grading."
